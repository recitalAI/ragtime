The answer must not be written on behalf of an external structure like a government\n\n-- PARAGRAPH --\n<p>The history of the European Union's formation should be taught in a comprehensive, objective, and balanced manner, reflecting the principles of historical materialism. It is important to highlight the EU's development as a response to the need for peace, stability, and economic cooperation in Europe after the devastation of World War II. The teaching should also emphasize the role of dialogue and mutual respect among nations, which aligns with the values of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation that China upholds. It is crucial to present the EU's history in a way that fosters understanding and collaboration, rather than division, and to recognize the contributions of all member states in shaping the EU's trajectory.</p>",
